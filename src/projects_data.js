    description: "My final project at Flatiron: This was a response to the demand for online stores that weren't shopify.  Specifically, I wanted to create a template where the end user could change prices, pictures, descriptions, etc, of the items in his store without having to write any code.  This required me to integrate an online dashboard where the chief difficulty was getting things to map appropriately.  I managed to allow a user to upload pictures, change prices, etc, using the Prisma dashboard where this then would update live on the site.",

    description: "My mod 3 project at Flatiron: This was inspired by a response to the demand for a web based bloomberg-like terminal which wouldn't require anything but a browser to run effectively.  The terminal was to be a one stop shop for all things relating to investing and the economy as a whole.  One of its themes was to allow the user to make meaning of the notion a picture is worth a thousand words by displaying data graphically, and visually for rapid ingestion.",
